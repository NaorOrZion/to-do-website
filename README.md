# TODO application
Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.
In this TODO application, I have learned how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.

## Run Locally
To run your HTML file locally with Visual Studio Code, you can use the built-in extension called "Live Server".
Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Live Server Extension:**
- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
- Search for "Live Server" in the Extensions view search box.
- Install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey.

2. **Open Your HTML File:**
- Open your HTML file in Visual Studio Code.
  
3. **Right-Click and Open with Live Server:**
- Right-click anywhere in your HTML file.
- Select the option "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.
  
4. **Access Your Local Server:**
- The Live Server will open a new tab in your default web browser with your HTML file.
- The URL will be something like http://127.0.0.1:5500/your-html-file.html
